# Hospital Comparison Dashboard – HCAHPS Scores

This final project dashboard allows users to compare hospitals using the HCAHPS dataset. Filters enable comparisons by state, county, zip code, hospital name, and patient experience questions. Rankings are calculated based on patient satisfaction percent scores.

---

## Project Objectives

- Enable faceted filtering of hospitals by region
- Compare hospital profiles and rank by average patient satisfaction
- Allow detailed comparison of specific questions (e.g., doctor/nurse communication)

---

## Key Features

### Filter Capabilities
- Faceted filters: State → County → Zip
- Search and select by hospital name
- Filter by survey question (e.g., “Definitely Recommend”, “Doctor Communication”)

### Ranking & Profiles
- Bar chart rankings by average percent score
- Individual hospital profiles visualized with heatmaps and bar charts
- Color-coded scores highlight best/worst performers (above or below 75%)

---

## Design Rationale

- Filters and charts follow visualization best practices and HCAHPS usability standards
- Overview → Zoom/Filter → Detail-on-demand layout
- Accessibility: simplified labels, appropriate color contrast, hover-to-detail
