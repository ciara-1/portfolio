### COVID-19 Patient Data Integration

**Tools:** Python (Pandas), MongoDB  
**Goal:** Integrate and clean patient data from multiple sources to perform COVID-19 data analysis  

**Project Summary:**  
This project focused on integrating and analyzing synthetic patient data from three distinct sources: two CSV files and a MongoDB database. The objective was to simulate a real-world data wrangling scenario where health data scientists must clean, merge, and extract meaningful insights across heterogeneous data systems. Using Pandas and MongoDB, key metrics and trends were identified regarding COVID-19 patients, such as frequency of symptoms, diagnosis distributions, and overall patient volume. This helped demonstrate scalable and reproducible methods in health data engineering.

**Files Included:**  
- `Assignment2.ipynb`: Jupyter Lab notebook containing data cleaning, analysis, and visualization  
- `Assignment2.html`: html version of Juputer Lab notebook 
- `patient_data_1.csv` & `patient_data_2.csv`: Dataset used
- `project_description.md` : This project overview

*Note: This project uses synthetic data for educational purposes. No real patient data is included.*
