# NIH Funding Analysis

## Summary
This project simulates tasks assigned to a health data scientist at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The goal is to apply “little” Big Data techniques to analyze large-scale NIH funding data, transforming raw Excel data into actionable insights and visualizations.

## Scenario
The NIH governing board needs a detailed report on funding trends for a specific year. However, the data is stored in an exceptionally large Excel file that cannot be effectively analyzed using standard spreadsheet tools. Your task is to use Python and data wrangling techniques to extract, clean, and visualize key metrics that will inform NIH leadership decisions.

## Skills Used
- Data wrangling and transformation
- Large Excel file handling
- Summary statistics generation
- Visualization of funding patterns
- Report preparation for stakeholders

## Files Included
- `Assignment1.ipynb` : Jupyter Lab notebook containing data cleaning, analysis, and visualization
- `Assignment1.html` : html version of Juputer Lab notebook
- `nih-Worldwide2015.xls`, `papers.csv`, & `us-states.csv`: Datasets used
- `project_description.md` : This project overview
