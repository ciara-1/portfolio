# Outpatient Data Analysis Using OOP (Python)

**Tool:** Python  
**Skills:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), dictionary parsing, data encapsulation, frequency analysis  
**Goal:** Analyze outpatient visit data using a custom `Patient` class to determine the most frequent diagnosis.

---

## Tasks Performed

- Defined a `Patient` class with attributes:
  - `patient_id`, `total_visits`, `physician_list`, and `diagnosis_codes`
- Created a method to calculate the most frequent diagnosis using built-in Python dictionaries
- Handled edge cases such as duplicate physicians and flexible input formats
- Tested the logic using simulated patient visit records

---

## Files Included

- `Project1.py`: Python script with complete class implementation and test scenario

---

*Note: All logic implemented using standard Python libraries. No external dependencies required.*
