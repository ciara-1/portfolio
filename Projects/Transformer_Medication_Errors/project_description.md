# Transformer-Based Models for Medication Error Detection

**Tools:** PubMed, EMBASE, Medline  
**Methods:** PRISMA Framework, Systematized Literature Review  
**Focus Area:** Artificial Intelligence in Clinical Safety

---

## Project Goal

Evaluate the effectiveness of transformer-based technologies such as ePrescribing, CDSS, and clinical NLP tools in detecting and preventing medication errors in healthcare settings.

---

## Summary

Conducted a comprehensive review of peer-reviewed studies (2020â€“2024) using the PRISMA framework. The review analyzed the performance of transformer-based models in identifying errors in drug dosage, interactions, administration, and prescription workflows. Findings suggest transformer models improved detection accuracy, especially in EHR-integrated settings.
