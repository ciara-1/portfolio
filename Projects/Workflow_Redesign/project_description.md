# Future State Workflow Redesign — SBMI Oncology Hospital

**Tools:** Lucidchart, Microsoft Word, Microsoft Teams  
**Goal:** Redesign the patient transport process between the oncology unit and radiation therapy department to improve communication, reduce delays, and enhance safety.

**Project Summary:**  
This project presents a comprehensive redesign of interdepartmental patient transport at SBMI Oncology Hospital. It integrates physical infrastructure changes (e.g., hallway expansions, signage improvements, digital waiting areas) with informatics solutions (e.g., BMIEHR+ integration, electronic handoffs, real-time transport tracking). Deliverables include process flow diagrams, EHR optimization blueprints, a digitized “Ticket to Ride” form, and a Yourdon data flow diagram. The proposed workflow enhances communication, eliminates paper-based delays, and aligns with quality and safety goals through improved interoperability and accountability.

**Files Included:**
